				I did this project in my previous Game Design class. The goal was to create a game that shows we understand the aspects of game design being taught. I decided to make a horror escape room game with the goal being collection of objects to escape. The player is stuck in a school and must retrieve three keys to leave and win the game. The camera shows the three rooms the player must go through to get to the final room where the player can exit. The hallway, the cafeteria, and the art class. The video shows the keys and where they are located. Blood indicates where the keys are to lead the players’ eyes to them.

			I did this project in my previous Game Design class. The goal was to create a game that shows we understand the aspects of game design being taught. I decided to make another collection game with a more complex story. The player is a scientist and is working on a time travel machine when the machine accidentally gets triggered. The player travels through time and must find a way to get back. Some parts of the machine have scattered throughout time and the player must retrieve all three parts in these locations to successfully travel back. A basement, a doctor’s office, and a scientist lab. The player will have to travel through time, fight zombies, talk to NPCs, and acquire parts.
