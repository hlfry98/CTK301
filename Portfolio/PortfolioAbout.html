			<h2>MORE ABOUT ME</h2>
            <img src="grad.jpeg" alt="Me" />
		<p>
			Thank you so much for visiting and wanting to learn more about me! I'm Hannah Fry and I was born and raised in Burbank Illinois. Some of my hobbies are reading, writing, painting, drawing, playing video games, and watching anime. I've always wanted to be a part of game development ever since I was a kid. For 7 years I was in healthcare, but I wasn't happy and wanted to go back to school to follow my dreams.

		<h3>EDUCATION</h3>

			I'm currently studying at Illinois State University for my bachelor’s degree in Game Design. I graduated from Joliet Junior College in the spring of 2024 with my associate’s in applied science and a certificate in Game Design.

		<h3>AREAS OF INTEREST</h3>
		<p>
			As I continue my degree, I have been especially interested in 3D modeling/animation, UI/UX design, narrative writing, and character design.
